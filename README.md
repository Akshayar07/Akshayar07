## Hey there, I'm Akshaya 👋

🎯 I build beautiful, fast mobile apps with **Flutter** — and I'm kinda obsessed with making UI smart, dynamic, and scalable.

## What I'm vibing with lately

- 🌱 Learning: The latest Flutter updates (they move fast!)
- 💬 Ask me about: Flutter widgets, travel hacks
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've debugged code in X different countries

## Currently in my rotation 🎧
- 📱 Day mission: Creating Flutter apps that users love
- 🌍 Side quest: Planning my next travel adventure
- 📚 Learning: Advanced Flutter animations
